    <div class="internalcontainer2"><h1>TRESOR</h1><img class="tresor" src="Img/tresor.jpeg" width="100%"/>One of the most unique techno-clubs in Berlin is definitely Tresor. This club is located under the ground and feels like a war bunker. This Berliner club goes way back and was opened in 1991. Unfortunately the first location (in the Leipziger Stra√üe) was closed down in 2005. Lucky enough a new location was found in 2007: It can be found not far from station Heinrich-Heine Stra√üe between Berlin-Mitte and Kreuzberg. Three floors offer enough space for dancing, while the basement with its solid concrete walls brings back memories of the old safe.Visiting Tresor is a special experience. The combination of an underground-bunker, an overload of blacklight and plenty of proper techno-sounds will definitely leave an impression. The door-policy is not as strict as many other Berliner techno-clubs. The entrance for a party-night in this club costs about 15 Euro and the parties normally go on till lunch-time the next day.

      <p class="card-text">As a wide-ranging, broad lifestyle project, Anomalie is promising to blast away old borders. Conceived and created by the Stay Free Kollektiv, the brand new venue offers an infrastructure for music, arts, nightlife events of all kinds, exhibitions, creative workshops, sports and various other leisure activities.
        All events are integrated with elements touching the areas of artistic exploration, scientific research, as well as spirituality ‚Äì in short: a place for a constant learning process and evolution. The name and concept were born out of the desire to deviate from the norm, the rule, from its rigidities and continuous subliminal suggestions, while underlining the ever-new righteousness of being oneself ‚Äì as individuals and as a collective. Anomalie doesn‚Äôt need to follow any trends, patterns or systems - it falls out of them, while creating a deviance, a novelty, a variation.

One of the most known parties there is called Mess and it hosts female djs only, giving space to womens in such a male dominant industry. The club's program managers are also open to art and so there are regular parties that combine music and installations or performances.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">TRESOR</h5>
      <p class="card-text">One of the most unique techno-clubs in Berlin is definitely Tresor. This club is located under the ground and feels like a war bunker. This Berliner club goes way back and was opened in 1991. Unfortunately the first location (in the Leipziger Stra√üe) was closed down in 2005. Lucky enough a new location was found in 2007: It can be found not far from station Heinrich-Heine Stra√üe between Berlin-Mitte and Kreuzberg. Three floors offer enough space for dancing, while the basement with its solid concrete walls brings back memories of the old safe.Visiting Tresor is a special experience. The combination of an underground-bunker, an overload of blacklight and plenty of proper techno-sounds will definitely leave an impression. The door-policy is not as strict as many other Berliner techno-clubs. The entrance for a party-night in this club costs about 15 Euro and the parties normally go on till lunch-time the next day.

      <h5 class="card-title">KIT KAT</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The KitKatClub is said to attract patrons from all over Europe and other parts of the world because of its music selection (techno and trance music) and its sexually uninhibited parties. The motto of the club is "Do what you want but stay in communication". Guests are allowed to engage in sexual intercourse openly at the venue. A strict dress code needs to be respected in order to get into the KitKatClub door, often enforced by Kirsten herself, and requiring fetish, latex, leather, kinky, high style, and glamour. The venue consists of three dance floors and an outdoor area with a pool. It is decorated with ultra-violet light and fluorescent color paintings done by the Berlin-based painter Vigor Calma aka "Der Tr√§umer" (the dreamer).</p>

      <p class="card-text">A new home for Griessmuehle has  been found. The club is now to settle in Sch√∂neweide - again in an industrial wasteland, but also one that should be properly upgraded. The new location is the site of the former B√§renquell brewery in Niedersch√∂neweide. After all, this has been empty for a quarter of a century - and iit should grow into a trend area - with restaurants, a university campus, culture and club life, with the aim of preserving as much of the industrial ruin graffiti charm as possible. </p>
